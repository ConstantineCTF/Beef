**Beef** is a playful, front-end web project designed to simulate a "hacked" screen for educational and entertainment purposes. Built with pure HTML and JavaScript (`index.html` and `hook.js`), it features glitch effects and a countdown timer to create a dramatic, prank-style experience. This project is intended for ethical use only, such as harmless pranks with consent or as a coding demonstration for learning front-end development.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is a joke and contains **no malicious code**, **no malware**, and **no actual hacking**. Use it responsibly and only with permission.

## Features
- **Realistic Simulation**: Displays a "hacked" screen with glitchy text effects and a countdown timer for added drama.
- **Pure Front-End**: Built using only HTML and JavaScript (`index.html` and `hook.js`), with no external dependencies.
- **Safe and Fun**: Contains no malicious functionality; designed for harmless pranks or educational demos.
- **Customizable**: Modify the HTML or JavaScript to tweak the message, timer, or visual effects.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConstantineCTF/Beef.git
   cd Beef
   ```

2. **No Dependencies Required**:
   - The project uses vanilla HTML and JavaScript, so no additional packages or installations are needed.

3. **Run Locally or Host**:
   - **Local**: Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the page.
   - **Host**: Serve the files using a simple web server, e.g., Python’s HTTP server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Access the page at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage
1. **Run the Page**:
   - Open `index.html` directly in a browser to test the prank page.
   - Alternatively, host it on a web server to share with others (with their consent).

2. **Customize (Optional)**:
   - Edit `index.html` to change the displayed text (e.g., modify the "hacked" message).
   - Modify `hook.js` to adjust the countdown timer duration or glitch effect behavior.

3. **Prank Responsibly**:
   - Share the page link with friends or colleagues who have explicitly agreed to the prank.
   - Use it as a demo in coding workshops or CTF-related presentations to showcase front-end techniques.

**Example**:
- Open `index.html` to see a screen with glitchy text like “You’ve Been Hacked!” and a countdown timer.
- For a prank, send the hosted URL to a friend (with permission) for a fun reaction.

## Legal and Ethical Use
This project is intended for **educational** and **entertainment** purposes only. Please follow these guidelines:
